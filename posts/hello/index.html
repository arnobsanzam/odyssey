My name is Arnob, and I am a software engineer with a passion for creating efficient and effective solutions to complex problems. With expertise in Java, SpringBoot, Microservices, REST, and Kafka, I strive to stay at the forefront of emerging technologies and deliver exceptional results for every project I undertake.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s not all work and no play for me! In addition to my technical skills, I bring a good sense of humor to the table and love to inject some levity into even the most challenging projects. When I&rsquo;m not coding or brainstorming solutions, you can usually find me curled up with a good movie. I am an avid movie buff and believe that storytelling is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal.</p><p>I invite you to take a look around my portfolio and see some of the projects I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to work on. From simple applications to complex systems, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, each of which has taught me something new and valuable.</p><p>Thank you for visiting my site, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!</p></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2023 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
